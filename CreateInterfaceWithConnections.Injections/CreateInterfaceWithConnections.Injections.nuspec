    <description>this library is to avoid wasting time with interface, service and controller connections and to write faster and less tedious code.

Enable the UseUML() extension method by writing "app.UseUML()" in Program.cs, run the program once to create a UML controller. Since the UML controller is created at runtime, you can't use it in this case, then restart the program and send a request to "UMLController" with the Get protocol, and then enter the data into the console as shown below.

Before reading the instructions, I would like to say that this library accepts and writes every line you write, so when sending data, follow the rules of writing an interface.

Enter the interface methods/properties line by line without using \";\" and start the method name with \"Get/Post/Put/Patch/Delete\" if you want the http protocol to be added to your methods in the controller. . When finished, type \"Yes\" in the console and press Enter."

Good luck C# dude.
